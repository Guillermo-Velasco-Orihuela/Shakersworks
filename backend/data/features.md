# Core Features

1. **Workspaces & Boards**  
   - Create multiple Workspaces, each with a Kanban-style Board to visualize task progress.  
   - Columns can be customized (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done), and tasks can be drag-dropped between them.

2. **Knowledge Base**  
   - Author documentation in Markdown with built-in version control.  
   - Link tasks directly to KB articles so every ticket has the relevant context.

3. **Real-Time Collaboration**  
   - Live cursors and comments on documents.  
   - Presence indicators let you know whoâ€™s viewing or editing a page right now.

4. **Integrations**  
   - Out-of-the-box connectors for Slack, Jira, GitHub, and Google Calendar.  
   - Webhooks and a REST API (see `api.md`) for custom integrations.

5. **Analytics & Reporting**  
   - Dashboard with pipeline metrics: tasks completed per sprint, article edit frequency, and team activity heatmaps.  
   - Exportable CSV and JSON reports for deeper analysis.
