# Inviting Collaborators

Shakers makes it easy to bring your team on board:

1. **Workspace-Level Invites**  
   - In any Workspace, open **Settings → Collaborators**.  
   - Enter one or more email addresses and assign a role (Viewer, Editor, Admin).  
   - Click **Send Invites**. Pending invites appear in the list until accepted.

2. **Organization-Level Management**  
   - If you’re on an Enterprise plan, navigate to the **Organization** console.  
   - You can bulk-upload users via CSV, set global role defaults, and enforce SSO settings.

3. **Roles & Permissions**  
   - **Viewer**: Can read boards and docs, but not edit.  
   - **Editor**: Can create and modify tasks, docs, and comments.  
   - **Admin**: Full control—manage billing, integrations, and user roles.

4. **Audit Logs**  
   - All invite/role-change events are logged under **Organization → Audit Logs** with timestamps and actor identities.
