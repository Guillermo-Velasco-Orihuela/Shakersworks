# Introduction to Shakers

Shakers is a cloud-native, collaborative task and knowledge-management platform designed for distributed teams. It brings together project planning, document sharing, and real-time collaboration into a single workspace, so your team never loses context.

With Shakers you can create **Workspaces** to organize projects, invite collaborators, and assign tasks. Every Workspace includes a built-in **Knowledge Base** where you can author and version markdown documents, so your team’s know-how is always up to date.

Shakers integrates with your existing toolchain—calendar, chat, and CI/CD pipelines—so you spend less time context-switching. And because it’s built on a modern microservices architecture, Shakers scales from small startups to enterprise-grade deployments effortlessly.

Whether you’re coordinating a 3-person design sprint or rolling out a company-wide knowledge hub, Shakers provides the flexibility and structure you need to keep everyone aligned.
